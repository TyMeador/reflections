-You can instantly see the changes made between files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
-Pros: Commits will more often have one clear logical purpose a piece, making both debugging and future developement much more effecient

-The systems were designed with two different end users in mind

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
