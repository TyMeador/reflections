When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-When more than one person is working on a project at a time

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-If someone makes changes on github while you are working locally, Git could pull changes overwriting all of your local work.
