When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-When more than one person is working on a project at a time

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-If someone makes changes on github while you are working locally, Git could pull changes overwriting all of your local work. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-forks allow you to make a copy of someone's work so you can modify it as you please. This also gives credit to the Origional Author, as all forks lead back to the origional repository

-Clones are exact copies of repositories. They don't care about the repository they were cloned from.

-Branches are like forks, but on a local repository
